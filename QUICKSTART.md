# üöÄ Quick Start Guide

## Start the Application

1. **Navigate to project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /Applications/CourseCluster/CourseCluster
   ```

2. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

3. **Open your browser:**
   - Main Application: http://localhost:8080
   - H2 Database Console: http://localhost:8080/h2-console

## Using the Web Interface

### Step 1: Create Your Room
1. Enter a room name (e.g., "My Dorm Room")
2. Set dimensions:
   - Length: 15 feet (typical dorm room)
   - Width: 12 feet
3. Click **"Create Room"**

### Step 2: Place Furniture
1. Click on any furniture item in the left panel (it will highlight)
2. Click anywhere on the canvas to place it
3. The furniture appears as a colored rectangle with its name

### Step 3: Manage Your Layout
- **Remove furniture**: Click on any placed item and confirm deletion
- **Load saved rooms**: Click "Load Existing Rooms" button
- **Create new rooms**: Adjust dimensions and create another room

## Testing the API with cURL

### Get all furniture objects:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/objects
```

### Create a room:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/rooms \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"My Room","length":15,"width":12}'
```

### Get all rooms:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/rooms
```

### Place furniture (use room_id=1, object_id=1 for Twin Bed):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/placements \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"roomId":1,"objectId":1,"x":2.0,"y":3.0,"rotation":0}'
```

### Get placements for a room:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/placements/room/1
```

## H2 Database Console

1. Go to: http://localhost:8080/h2-console
2. Use these settings:
   - **JDBC URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:roomlayout`
   - **Username**: `sa`
   - **Password**: (leave empty)
3. Click **Connect**

### Useful SQL Queries:

**View all furniture:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM objects;
```

**View all rooms:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM rooms;
```

**View placements with details:**
```sql
SELECT 
    p.placement_id,
    r.name as room_name,
    o.name as object_name,
    p.x, p.y
FROM placements p
JOIN rooms r ON p.room_id = r.room_id
JOIN objects o ON p.object_id = o.object_id;
```

## Available Furniture (Pre-loaded)

| ID | Name | Dimensions | Color |
|----|------|------------|-------|
| 1 | Twin Bed | 3' √ó 6.5' | Brown |
| 2 | Desk | 4' √ó 2' | Saddle Brown |

## Stopping the Application

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the application is running.

## Troubleshooting

### Port 8080 already in use:
```bash
# Find and kill the process
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
```

### Application won't start:
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
./gradlew clean build
./gradlew bootRun
```

### Frontend not loading:
- Make sure you're accessing http://localhost:8080 (not https)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify the application started successfully in terminal

### Database issues:
- The H2 database is in-memory, so data is lost when you restart
- For persistent data, switch to MySQL (see README.md)

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Create multiple rooms with different dimensions
2. ‚úÖ Experiment with different furniture arrangements
3. ‚úÖ Try the REST API endpoints with cURL or Postman
4. ‚úÖ Explore the H2 console to see database structure
5. ‚úÖ Modify furniture colors in the database
6. ‚úÖ Add custom furniture items via API

## Tips for Success

- **Scale**: 1 grid square = 1 foot
- **Typical dorm dimensions**: 12-15 feet √ó 10-12 feet
- **Plan before placing**: Think about traffic flow and functionality
- **Use the grid**: Align furniture to grid lines for neat layouts
- **Save often**: Placements are auto-saved to database
